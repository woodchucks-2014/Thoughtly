Discoveree is a topic exploration website and Chome extension.

Have you ever found an article on a topic of interest, but did not have the time to finish reading the article or explore the topic in greater detail?

With Discoveree, users can easily mark topics of interest and return to them later.  Discoveree takes the topic, and searches for relevant information using the following APIs:

* Freebase
* TED Talks
* YouTube
* Wikipedia
* Coursera

The information is stored in an intutitive and user-friendly single-page interface, allowing users to quickly explore topics in detail.
